This project uses an Arduino connected to a physical keyboard which will send
"on-off" information about each pin (key) via USB.  A Java program will read
this information and play the appropriate MIDI note.

You should install the Arduino IDE (download from arduino.cc) as this uses
RXTX libraries which are installed as part of Arduino.
